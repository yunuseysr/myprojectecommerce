## NOTICE!

I opened an account on Amazon web services and manually uploaded the datasets first. Then I tried to download it with
the downloadS3.py file, but unfortunately I could not download it.

I used uploadS3.py to delete the datasets I uploaded manually and add the datasets I downloaded from Kaggle this time.
However, I could not complete this structure.

I used boto3 library for Upload and Download. It did not respond regarding connection to AWS, although it contained
Access Point and Security ID information.
